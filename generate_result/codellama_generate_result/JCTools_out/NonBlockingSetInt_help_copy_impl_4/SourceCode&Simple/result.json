        "\nThe `help_copy_impl` method is a helper method for the `NonBlockingSetInt` class. It is used to implement the copying of bits from one array to another, and it is called by the `help_copy` method. The method takes an integer argument `i`, which represents the index of the bit in the old array that should be copied.\n\nThe implementation of the `help_copy_impl` method consists of several steps:\n\n1. It retrieves the old and new bit arrays, using the `_nbsi64` field of the `NBSI` class.\n2. It determines whether the old array word is not immutable yet (i.e., it has a non-zero value in its sign bit). If this is the case, then the method sets the sign bit of the old array word to make it immutable.\n3. If the new array word is zero (i.e., its sign bit is set), then the method copies the bits from the old array word to the new array word using a CAS operation.\n4. The method then checks whether the old and new array words are both non-zero, in which case it sets the sign bit of the old array word to zero (i.e., makes it non-immutable).\n5. Finally, the method returns the new array word.\n\nOverall, the `help_copy_impl` method is responsible for implementing a copying mechanism that allows bits from one array to be copied to another. This is an important part of the implementation of the `NonBlockingSetInt` class, as it enables the class to efficiently implement the `add`, `remove`, and `contains` methods.",

        "\nThe `help_copy_impl` method is a private helper method for the `NonBlockingSetInt` class. It is used to implement the copy functionality of the `NonBlockingSetInt` class, which allows it to be copied from an existing instance to a new instance.\n\nThe method takes an integer index `i` as input and returns a new `NBSI` object that represents the copied version of the original `NBSI` object at position `i`. The method first retrieves the current value of the `_nbsi64` field in the original `NBSI` object, which is a nested array of `NBSI` objects. It then checks if the new bitset for the copy operation has already been initialized (i.e., whether the `_new` field is non-null). If it has not been initialized, the method initializes it by creating a new `NBSI` object with a capacity equal to the current size of the original array.\n\nNext, the method iterates over each element in the original nested array and copies its value to the corresponding element in the new nested array. However, if the element is zero in the old array but non-zero in the new array, the method does not copy it to avoid overwriting any existing data that has been copied so far.\n\nFinally, the method returns a reference to the new `NBSI` object that represents the copied version of the original `NBSI` object at position `i`. This is used as the new value of the `_nbsi64` field in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nThe JUnit test case for this method should cover the following scenarios:\n\n1. Copying an empty array: The test should ensure that a copy of an empty array is created correctly, with all elements set to zero.\n2. Copying a non-empty array: The test should ensure that a copy of a non-empty array is created correctly, with the correct values copied from the original array.\n3. Handling null pointers: The test should ensure that the method handles null pointers correctly, by not attempting to access any elements in the original nested array or the new nested array if either one is null.\n4. Ensuring the copied array has the same size as the original array: The test should ensure that the copied array has the same number of elements as the original array.\n5. Ensuring the copied array contains the correct values: The test should ensure that the copied array contains the correct values, including those that have been updated during the copy operation.\n6. Handling out-of-bounds accesses: The test should ensure that the method handles out-of-bounds accesses correctly, by not attempting to access any elements outside the bounds of the original nested array or the new nested array.\n7. Ensuring the correctness of the copied values: The test should ensure that the copied values are correct, including those that have been updated during the copy operation.\n8. Handling null objects: The test should ensure that the method handles null objects correctly, by not attempting to access any elements in the original nested array or the new nested array if either one is null.\n9. Ensuring the copied array has the correct type: The test should ensure that the copied array has the same type as the original array.\n10. Ensuring the correctness of the copied values: The test should ensure that the copied values are correct, including those that have been updated during the copy operation.",

        "The `help_copy_impl` method is a private helper method in the `NBSI` class that is called by the `help_copy` method. The purpose of this method is to copy bits from one array to another, while ensuring that the new array is immutable and has a valid copy of the bits.\n\nThe method starts by initializing some local variables, including the `old` and `nnn` arrays, which represent the source and destination arrays respectively. It then enters a loop where it checks if the current bit index (`j`) is equal to 63 (the sign bit). If it is, it recursively calls the method again with the new index (`j>>6`).\n\nOnce the loop exits, the method proceeds to check if the old array word is not immutable yet. If it's not, it sets the sign bit in the old array word to make it immutable. Then, it checks if non-zero bits are present in both arrays and performs a CAS (compare-and-swap) operation on them.\n\nIf the CAS operation fails, the method retries until it succeeds. If it's successful, it breaks out of the loop and proceeds to the next step.\n\nThe next step is to check if the new array word is not immutable yet. If it's not, it sets the sign bit in the new array word to make it immutable. Then, it checks if non-zero bits are present in both arrays and performs a CAS operation on them.\n\nIf the CAS operation fails, the method retries until it succeeds.
