The `setWay()` method is a recursive function that tries to find a path for the ball in the maze. It works by checking each possible move (up, down, left, right) from its current position and marking those moves as "feasible" or "not feasible". If the ball reaches the end of the maze, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to try all possible paths until a path is found.

The method starts by checking if the ball has reached the end of the maze already (i.e., if the current position is at `[6][5]`). If so, it returns true indicating that a path was found. Otherwise, it checks each of the four possible moves from its current position and marks those moves as "feasible" or "not feasible".

If the ball cannot move in any direction (i.e., all four moves are not feasible), it marks the current position as "dead end" and returns `false`. This indicates that there is no path to the maze's exit from this point, and the backtracking algorithm can go one step up in the recursion tree and try another move at the previous position.

The method calls itself recursively until a path is found or all possible moves have been exhausted.

The `setWay2()` method is similar to the `setWay()` method but with an alternative set of moves (up, right, down, left). This is done to show that there can be multiple solutions for a maze problem and the backtracking algorithm can find different paths if it is given different starting points.

Here are some possible test cases:
1. The ball starts from position `[0][0]` in the maze and reaches the exit at `[6][5]`: The `setWay()` method should return `true` because a path was found, and the `setWay2()` method should also return `true`.
2. The ball starts from position `[0][0]` in the maze but cannot reach the exit: The `setWay()` method should return `false` because there is no path to the maze's exit from this point, and the `setWay2()` method should also return `false`.
3. The ball starts from position `[6][5]` in the maze but cannot reach the exit: The `setWay()` method should return `false` because there is no path to the maze's exit from this point, and the `setWay2()` method should also return `false`.
4. The ball starts from position `[3][3]` in the maze but cannot reach the exit: The `setWay()` method should return `false` because there is no path to the maze's exit from this point, and the `setWay2()` method should also return false.
5. The ball starts from position `[0][4]` in the maze but cannot reach the exit: Both methods (`setWay()` and `setWay2()`) should return false indicating that there is no path to the maze's exit from this point.

### Solution 2: Using backtracking to find the path for the ball in the maze

* [Ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm)
* [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/)
* [Backtracking Tutorial and Example Problems | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-tutorial-and-example-problems/)

### Algorithm:

1. If the ball is in position `map[6][5]`, means that we have found a path, return true
2. If the current position of the ball is not 0, means it has been gone through before or cannot go to the wall，return false
3. If the path can be done(means we can pass through this point), then let the ball go through and set `map[i][j]` to 2
4. Recursive call for each move: down->right->up->left, if any of these moves does not work, then it will backtrack to the previous step and try another path
5. If all possible paths are tried but still cannot find the path, return false
6. Print out the new map with the ball footprint, you should be able to see how the ball is moving in the maze
7. After we found a path for the ball, then let the ball go through the maze according to the path we set
8. Set the `map[i][j]` back to 0 to indicate that the ball has passed through this point and update the position of the ball
9. If the ball cannot find its way out in the maze, it will stay at a dead end
10. Print out the new map with the ball footprint again, you should be able to see how the ball is moving in the maze after the ball goes through the maze for one time 
11. After we find a path for the ball, let's try another strategy: up->right->down->left and repeat step 3-10
12. Now you have two maps with the ball footprint, one is from down->right->up->left, and another one is from up->right->down->left, print them out to show the difference between the two strategies
